# Hotel-Management-System
The hotel management system web page front end project aims to create a user-friendly interface that streamlines and enhances the experience of both guests and hotel staff. This responsive and intuitive platform will allow guests to easily browse room availability, make reservations, and manage their bookings, while providing staff with tools for efficient room management, check-ins, and customer service. The front end design will prioritize accessibility, clean navigation, and visual appeal, integrating seamlessly with the back end system to ensure a cohesive and enjoyable user experience for all stakeholders involved in the hotel management process.
